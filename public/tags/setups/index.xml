      <title>Linux on a Convertible, Round 2</title>

      <description>Preamble In my Setups post, I mentioned that I used to use a ThinkPad X390 Yoga as my main workhorse. I was hoping that a convertible laptop could replace both my aging MacBook and iPad; as it turned out the software wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready yet and it was a pretty shitty experience overall. Next thing, Covid happened, and being stuck at home, I switched to a desktop Hackintosh plus an iPad Pro.</description>

      <description>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with virtualization a bit. I wanna give a high level overview of the project first, and then dive into a few details.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently using a i7-6700, 16GB RAM, Radeon RX570 Hackintosh and the goal was running both a virtualized Windows and macOS on that machine simultaneously, using Linux as host. The RX570 would be passed through to the Windows VM for gaming, with macOS getting the iGPU as &amp;ldquo;work OS&amp;rdquo; and Linux just running headless.</description>

      <title>Pi Zero</title>

      <description>Updated Feb 22: details and clarification
So last week I bought a Pi Zero hoping it could replace the AWS EC2 instance that I currently use as a SSH server for my iPad Pro. I use this to do actual programming work on the iPad, and overall, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with this setup even though it&amp;rsquo;s got a few warts.
 My motivation for going with a local SSH server is mostly in not being dependent on a decent internet connection, though price, control and ping are upsides as well.</description>

      <title>The elusive perfect setup</title>

      <description>In the last few years, I have spent a lot of effort trying to find a nice computing setup. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally converged on something that I am pretty content with, at least right now during COVID and WFH. Of course, everybody has different needs, as a CS student I personally need a system that lets me take (preferably digital) handwritten notes and write code. With COVID, I also went back to playing video games more.</description>
