      <title>Pi Zero</title>

      <description>Updated Feb 22: details and clarification
So last week I bought a Pi Zero hoping it could replace the AWS EC2 instance that I currently use as a SSH server for my iPad Pro. I use this to do actual programming work on the iPad, and overall, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with this setup even though it&amp;rsquo;s got a few warts.
My motivation for going with a local SSH server is mostly in not being dependent on a decent internet connection, though price, control and ping are upsides as well.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m generifying the title of this series, because with the latest addition, the lab&amp;rsquo;s not just a Mac Mini anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ve dusted off my Raspberry Pi, which I habitually do, roughly every couple of months, intending to start some project until interest wanes about two weeks later and the Pi goes back on the shelf. This time I&amp;rsquo;ve hooked it up to my TV and installed RPiPlay, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got a feeling that the Pi has finally found a good home.</description>

      <description>This is an update pertaining to my last post. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a couple useful services and built a primitive but dynamic landing page.
Setup All the services are running their own servers, each listening on a different port. The landing page is powered by Node.js listening on port 80 and has links to everything else. Since some of the services are data intensive, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up the landing page to display current disk usage.</description>

      <description>Recently, a family member replaced her aging 2012 Mac Mini with a custom gaming rig. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been lying around, and because it&amp;rsquo;s a decently specced machine for its time (Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM) I figured maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some use I can put it to.
The main reasons for replacing it were lack of graphics power and it was extremely sluggish due to its old 5400rpm 2.5&amp;quot; HDD. However, CPU performance is still in perfectly usable realms.</description>

      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s for anyone just getting started with cooking.
While I&amp;rsquo;m far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not too impressive in itself, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were so low that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald&amp;rsquo;s takeaway for dinner.</description>

      <description>These are my notes on mucking around with my old Xbox One for a bit. I swapped the drive and thermal paste and did some amateurish performance measurements of the latter.
 Skip to #The upgrade for step-by-step instructions for upgrading your drive. Skip to #Thermal paste for the thermal paste upgrade  Context So I bought the original Xbox One in 2015 when it was on sale for like 200 bucks.</description>
