      <description>Recently, a family member replaced her aging 2012 Mac Mini with a custom gaming rig. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been lying around, and because it&amp;rsquo;s a decently specced machine for its time (Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM) I figured maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some use I can put it to.
The main reasons for replacing it were lack of graphics power and it was extremely sluggish due to its old 5400rpm 2.5&amp;quot; HDD. However, CPU performance is still in perfectly usable realms.</description>

      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s for anyone just getting started with cooking.
While I&amp;rsquo;m far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not too impressive in itself, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were so low that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald&amp;rsquo;s takeaway for dinner.</description>

      <description>These are my notes on mucking around with my old Xbox One for a bit. I swapped the drive and thermal paste and did some amateurish performance measurements of the latter.
 Skip to #The upgrade for step-by-step instructions for upgrading your drive. Skip to #Thermal paste for the thermal paste upgrade  Context So I bought the original Xbox One in 2015 when it was on sale for like 200 bucks.</description>
