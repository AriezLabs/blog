      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost exactly a year since COVID got real and so I thought I would write a bit on how my and my girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s life has been throughout the pandemic. This is going to be kind of a snapshot since things are changing all the time, but I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to look back at this at some point into the future where life has hopefully returned to normal.</description>

      <description>The new year is a reflective period for many people, but this year I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to set my goals differently than I usually do. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to figure out what my values currently are, then I came up with a bunch of ways to implement those values, and finally I selected the most promising ones to form the basis for concrete goals. Because it gets into the why and not just the what, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this approach will yield better results!</description>
