      <description>This recipe combines two of my favorite meals ever: fried chicken and Buldak, Korean fire chicken. It&amp;rsquo;s based on Serious Eat&amp;rsquo;s Buldak sauce and Quang Tran&amp;rsquo;s Sriracha Fried Chicken.
This is the first recipe I (in part) created on my own that&amp;rsquo;s so good I&amp;rsquo;m confident enough to share it. ðŸ˜‰ If you like fried chicken and spicy food, you&amp;rsquo;re going to love this.
Ingredients For one serving.
Buldak sauce:</description>

      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s for anyone just getting started with cooking.
While I&amp;rsquo;m far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not too impressive in itself, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were so low that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald&amp;rsquo;s takeaway for dinner.</description>
