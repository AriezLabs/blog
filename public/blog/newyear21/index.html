<p>The new year is a reflective period for many people, but this year I&rsquo;ve tried to set my goals differently than I usually do. Firstly I&rsquo;ve tried to figure out what my values currently are, then I came up with a bunch of ways to implement those values, and finally I selected the most promising ones to form the basis for concrete goals. Because it gets into the <em>why</em> and not just the <em>what</em>, I&rsquo;m hoping this approach will yield better results!</p>
<p>Since there is zero need to preface this post further with how shitty 2020 was, I&rsquo;ll just jump into a braindump about my plans and ideas for the next year(s).</p>
<h2 id="formulating-values">Formulating values<a class="anchor" href="#formulating-values">#</a></h2>
<p>One actually good thing that came out of 2020&rsquo;s constant lockdowns was my realization that experiences (as in vacations or nights out) are one of the most important things in life. This is not a groundbreaking idea at all, but I now have firsthand experience that illustrates it, so I can actually appreciate it. The depressing lack of notable experiences in 2020 made it very clear that I was underestimating how important social activity actually is to me, to the degree that before 2020, I used to think I&rsquo;m an introvert, now I know I&rsquo;m very much an extrovert.</p>
<p>So this is obviously valuable knowledge if you&rsquo;re trying to formulate goals for your future. The other kinda obvious thing I (re-)realized in a discussion with my girlfriend was that planning for more than the next couple of years, or in much detail, is futile. Life constantly comes at you with unpredictable surprises, so you have incomplete information about your future. You will just make subpar decisions and/or fall into the easy trap of analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>Having gained an appreciation for those insights, these are the things that I decided are most important to me <em>right now</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prioritizing experiences</li>
<li>Ability to support myself</li>
<li>Spending less time doing things I don&rsquo;t want to be doing</li>
</ul>
<p>Down the road I&rsquo;ll have to decide on a career or other options such as a startup, part-time work, or a remote job, and so it would also be nice to keep as many doors open as possible. After a <em>lot</em> of overthinking which choice would be best I realized that I can&rsquo;t decide on this now, plus I can always switch afterwards, plus as long as I finish my studies there&rsquo;s not much that I can do that would actually close any doors. So I guess that&rsquo;s a nice thing to not have to worry about.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation<a class="anchor" href="#implementation">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make a few observations about the values I chose:</p>
<p>The first two points tradeoff versus the last one. More experiences = spending more money = more time spent working; and similarly for supporting myself. But of course work can still be relatively enjoyable, or very time efficient, so those are important dimensions to optimize for. And some things you can learn to enjoy with the right mindset.</p>
<p>Next, prioritizing experiences does not automatically preclude material things because material things also provide experiences. It&rsquo;s just about whether it&rsquo;s a worthwhile experience given the investment. For example, I enjoy using my electric skateboard, or my HiFi speakers. But I will also admit that I&rsquo;d have been content with significantly cheaper alternatives, and so I have to recognize that I could&rsquo;ve easily avoided more work simply by being more of a literal cheapskate.</p>
<p>So with these thoughts in mind, here&rsquo;s a bit of brainstorming on moving towards those values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the proportion of unenjoyable tasks:
<ul>
<li>Earn passive income</li>
<li>Look for enjoyable work</li>
<li>Avoid soul-draining work
<ul>
<li>if impossible, get it over with instead of dragging on forever
<ul>
<li><em>ahem</em> my bachelor&rsquo;s thesis <em>ahem</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Take up enjoyable hobbies
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll enjoy coding more if I find some balance.</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t work productively all day long anyway.
<ul>
<li>I have a tendency to be unable to stop whatever I&rsquo;m doing right now</li>
<li>This is a benefit, but it also makes it hard to start working
<ul>
<li>Maybe commit to doing something for 15 minutes only, and only keep going if I want to.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And I need to get better at realizing when I&rsquo;m not being productive anymore and it would be better to stop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bonus points if it&rsquo;s a worthwhile hobby with good payoff</li>
<li>Sports is a good way to create good conditions for deep work.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Learn to enjoy mundane things
<ul>
<li>Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing the dishes etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reducing the amount of work I need to do:
<ul>
<li>Be smart about spending money
<ul>
<li>Find the price/performance sweet spot
<ul>
<li>Finding good deals is also enjoyable in itself</li>
<li>Buy used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Money is time</li>
<li>Avoid impulse buying</li>
<li>Track finances</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General ideas:
<ul>
<li>Focus on fewer things
<ul>
<li>Being scattered is no good.</li>
<li>For example, read fewer books on narrower topics (for now)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Follow a sustainable system for productivity and organization
<ul>
<li>Get a morning routine and consistent wakeup time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A marketable side project
<ul>
<li>Can be enjoyable work, and earn income, and look good on a resume</li>
<li>Several constraints though:
<ul>
<li>Must require a very low financial investment
<ul>
<li>EU grants might help though</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Should have technical merit for the resume</li>
<li>Should yield some payoff
<ul>
<li>Do market research and test hypotheses</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimally, it&rsquo;s enjoyable</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals">Goals<a class="anchor" href="#goals">#</a></h2>
<p>To conclude, I&rsquo;ve condensed these ideas into a few actionable items, sorted by importance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Side project: do any amount of work towards getting users every day</li>
<li>Productivity system
<ul>
<li>Every evening before bed, create a plan for tomorrow.</li>
<li>Note any to-do items that pop up in the calendar.</li>
<li>Keep track of these habits via a table on my whiteboard.</li>
<li>Also note these goals on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balance
<ul>
<li>Take time for cooking nice meals.</li>
<li>Write one blog post per week. (yes, you&rsquo;re seeing the result of this right now)</li>
<li>Do sports 3-4 times a week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Focus: <strong>don&rsquo;t</strong> take up anything new besides my app, cooking, and writing. Just see how far I can get with these this year.</li>
<li>Enjoying things: use up my ~10 unintentionally amassed Audible credits this year</li>
</ul>
<p>This is far less than I listed above - they&rsquo;re just the items that I think got the best effort/reward ratio. The other ideas are also very worthwhile, but taking these on now as well would probably be a bit too much. Instead, I want to see how focusing on just a few things goes. Next post about this in 2022 at the latest.</p>
