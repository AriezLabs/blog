<p>In the last few years, I have spent a lot of effort trying to find a nice computing setup. I&rsquo;ve finally converged on something that I am pretty content with, at least right now during COVID and WFH. Of course, everybody has different needs, as a CS student I personally need a system that lets me take (preferably digital) handwritten notes and write code. With COVID, I also went back to playing video games more. So right now, my personal requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Touchscreen and stylus</li>
<li>Big screen for coding and lectures</li>
<li>Something to game on</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2017">2017<a class="anchor" href="#2017">#</a></h2>
<p>In 2017, I started college with a 12&quot; MacBook and 1st gen iPad Pro. This setup was pretty great. I couldn&rsquo;t really game, but back then you could have a social life, so that was fine.</p>
<p>I <em>loved</em> the MacBook, it&rsquo;s a very convenient form factor, you could easily take it literally everywhere, it had USB-C docking, and it was just a pleasure to use in general. I think the original iPad Pro was a bit ahead of its time though, as in the tech wasn&rsquo;t quite ready yet. It got pretty warm when taking notes and I burned through almost half a charge in 3 hours of lectures. Back then my note taking system wasn&rsquo;t particularly sophisticated either (I was basically just taking standard handwritten notes in OneNote) and so I suspect I would&rsquo;ve been just as happy with a pen and paper in place of the iPad.</p>
<h2 id="2019">2019<a class="anchor" href="#2019">#</a></h2>
<p>In 2019, the MacBook slowly started to show its age (it got a bit slower with each OS update, as seems to be common with Apple). So I moved on to a pretty beefy ThinkPad X390 Yoga, hoping that it could replace both my laptop and my tablet.</p>
<p>Turns out, this kind of convertible is pretty awkward if you&rsquo;re typing something up and want to add a quick drawing. You either draw onto the erected screen (awkward) or you drop the screen to 180 degrees and draw (awkward) or you flip it (awkward). It&rsquo;s always <em>either</em> a laptop <em>or</em> a tablet, never both at the same time. And boy, is it a clunky tablet, both physically and from a usability standpoint. Neither Linux nor Windows are particularly usable with just a touchscreen, as is evident from (lack of) autorotate, tiny buttons, and many other minor annoyances that sum up into an unpleasurable experience.</p>
<p>The other issue with the X390 was shitty Linux support. The WiFi driver consistently crashed every couple of minutes when a Thunderbolt display was connected. Each crash froze the system for a few seconds and they occured once every few minutes, depending on kernel and driver version. It was really really annoying and I tried <em>everything</em> including submitting a kernel bug to no avail.</p>
<p>So while I had the highest expectations for this setup, I&rsquo;m rating it the worst out of all I&rsquo;ve had so far. It was a complete disappointment, to be frank. The awkwardness of the form factor even would&rsquo;ve been tolerable if the software wasn&rsquo;t close to unusable.</p>
<h2 id="2020">2020<a class="anchor" href="#2020">#</a></h2>
<p>When the lockdowns hit and I got bored, I dusted off my old gaming rig and turned it into a Hackintosh. This just took an afternoon of setup and it has been <em>rock solid</em> and probably my favorite computing device so far. Desktop upgradeability is worth a lot (I just recently upgraded to a 1TB SSD, paying roughly 17% of what Apple is charging) and you&rsquo;re not stuck with ultrabook thermals. For gaming, I kept Windows installed in parallel for a while, but later added a Fenvi PCIe WiFi card and replaced my useless nVidia GPU (no macOS drivers) with an AMD card. And so the need to dualboot was gone, as I can play LoL on macOS, and anything else on my <a href="../xbox/">upgraded Xbox</a> with Game Pass.</p>
<p>In 2020 I also added an iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard to the family. That thing has been the best implementation of the Convertible idea that I&rsquo;ve seen so far. Thanks to the magnets it&rsquo;s a breeze to attach or detach the keyboard, so it&rsquo;s easy to type and add drawings. Hardware-wise, the CPU is so fast you are just not going to max it out, the 120Hz display is sweet, build quality is superb as always, plus it&rsquo;s very lightweight which means it&rsquo;s also a comfortable reading device.</p>
<p>It also integrates seamlessly with macOS. I can take screenshots on my Hackintosh and mark them up on iPad, or AirDrop sketches directly to my Hackintosh. This is pretty invaluable for my current note-taking system.</p>
<p>But still the iPad&rsquo;s nowhere near its potential. It&rsquo;s <em>seriously</em> limited by iPadOS. Basically, iPadOS is great for any everyday tasks, but as soon as you stray off the usecases that Apple has envisioned for you, you&rsquo;re going to be fighting the OS. Usually there is <em>some</em> workaround to achieve whatever you need, but compared to doing the same on a desktop OS these workarounds are usually ridiculously involved. For example, to get an IDE, you can set up <a href="https://github.com/cdr/code-server">code-server</a> on your VPS and add a bookmark to it on your home screen. <a href="https://blink.sh/">Blink</a> is also a livesaver in that it gives you a proper shell to work with. But both Blink and code-server are remote and occasionally you do feel that.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an upshot to iPadOS&rsquo;s locked down mobile OS nature though: it&rsquo;s a perfectly usable tablet OS. (And this is not a given, as I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way.) On iPadOS, things like autorotate just work, you get smooth logins via FaceID, there&rsquo;s generally no fiddling around with technical issues like your microphone not working on a Zoom call, and so on.</p>
<p>In general, I find that the pros outweigh the cons, especially since I can just use my Hackintosh for anything iPadOS doesn&rsquo;t want me to do, and so this is my favorite setup so far.</p>
<h2 id="2021-and-on">2021 and on<a class="anchor" href="#2021-and-on">#</a></h2>
<p>Due to the limitations imposed by iPadOS, I&rsquo;m expecting to have to replace my desktop Hackintosh with a notebook once I&rsquo;m on the go more often again, though I want to see whether I can make the iPad work as my only mobile computing device first.</p>
<p>While Apple Silicon is looking like a gamechanger in the notebook market after years of Intel stagnation, I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of being locked in to Apple, especially seeing the recent big tech censorship events, so I&rsquo;m happy to see more open alternatives like the <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x1/ThinkPad-X1-Nano/p/22TP2X1X1N1">X1 Nano</a> or <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-x/X12-Detachable-G1/p/22TPX12X2D1">X12 Detachable</a> pop up in the sub-kilogram and convertible markets respectively, as well as progress being made on the software side (see e.g. <a href="https://www.jingos.com/">JingOS</a>).</p>
