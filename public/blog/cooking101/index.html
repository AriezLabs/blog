<p>This one&rsquo;s for anyone just getting started with cooking.</p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that&rsquo;s not too impressive in itself, but it&rsquo;s <em>far</em> from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were <em>so low</em> that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald&rsquo;s takeaway for dinner.</p>
<p>At some point I realized that really learning how to cook would be pretty worthwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health benefits</li>
<li>Saves money</li>
<li>Delicious food</li>
<li>No deep desire for McDonald&rsquo;s</li>
</ul>
<p>Since then, cooking has become kind of a hobby for me, so this year <a href="../newyear21/">I decided to double down</a> on it. I thought now&rsquo;d be a good time to explore what advice I&rsquo;d give my old McDonald&rsquo;s me to get him to a place where dinner is a highlight, not a necessity.</p>
<h2 id="salt">Salt<a class="anchor" href="#salt">#</a></h2>
<p>Use a <em>ton</em> of salt.</p>
<p>Seriously. I&rsquo;m not putting this first for no reason. If you&rsquo;re more the learning-by-doing type, here&rsquo;s an experiment that will make up your mind once and for all. (All credit goes to Samin Nosrat&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/">Salt Fat Acid Heat</a>).</p>
<p>First we&rsquo;re going to make some mayo. Yep, <em>make</em> some damn mayo, with our own hands. You&rsquo;re only going to need an egg yolk <strong>at room temperature</strong>, and 175ml of vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Place a small bowl on a damp dishrag for stability. Put the yolk in and start whisking while adding oil <strong>drop by drop</strong>. Literally. Mayo is an unforgiving bitch, and it&rsquo;s going to make you suffer if you add oil too quickly. You know you&rsquo;re doing it right if you&rsquo;re painfully slowly dripping oil into a creamy mass that is  slowly getting harder and harder to whisk, with the remaining amount of oil never seeming to shrink even a tiny bit, while your whisking arm is dying of exhaustion (I didn&rsquo;t say it was going to be a fun experiment).</p>
<p>As more oil is added, you can begin dripping a <em>tiny</em> bit faster. Don&rsquo;t get cocky - you can still easily fuck up your mayo. If you add oil too fast, your mayo will stop being creamy and become flaky. To save it, you gotta start over - just add the rest of the oil to your broken mayo, then put half a teaspoon of extra hot tap water into another bowl, and whisk your broken mayo mixture into that. Drop-wise, of course.</p>
<p>Once done, take some time to taste your mayo. After all, it&rsquo;s the product of a <em>lot</em> of pain, so this fresh, homemade mayo better be worth the effort.</p>
<p>But wait - it just tastes like nothing at all?</p>
<p>Now before you start making plans to find and murder me, let&rsquo;s move on to the second part of the experiment real quick. This one is going to be fun, I promise.</p>
<p>Prepare some more ingredients: you&rsquo;ll need some pounded anchovies and garlic, grated Parmesan, Worcestershire sauce and table salt. Just progressively mix them into your mayo until it tastes <em>amazing</em>.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s an experiment, you should also try going beyond the point where it tastes amazing - you can always dilute your overseasoned mayo with unseasoned mayo. (I won&rsquo;t even be mad at you if you use store-bought mayo for that.)</p>
<p>Finish it off with some lemon juice and vinegar. Do the same season-to-taste strategy.</p>
<p>Better now?</p>
<p>It should be a <em>world</em> of difference between this and your original, bland ass unseasoned mayo. Note how much of each ingredient you&rsquo;ve added until it was too much - most likely, you will find it took a lot more than you expected.</p>
<p>When I made this for the first time, I was pretty amazed that oil and an egg yolk could be made to taste this good. The reason this recipe works so well, Samin writes, is because you&rsquo;re <em>layering</em> salt from multiple different sources (each of our ingredients contains a lot of salt on its own).</p>
<p>You can serve your delicious dressing over some lettuce with croutons and impress your date (or your mum) with it. Thank me later. Oh, and an alternative that I also found to be delicious is mixing the dressing with canned tuna and building a fat sandwich with some lettuce and sliced bell peppers.</p>
<p>Now that it&rsquo;s clear <em>why</em> you should salt, let&rsquo;s conclude with a few general tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Salt from the inside: salt has numerous desirable effects on food besides making it saltier. For example, it makes meat more tender. But to get that effect, salting your steak at the table isn&rsquo;t enough - you should do it the night before and just let it sit in the fridge.</li>
<li>Use it everywhere: salt also <em>amplifies</em> flavors, so a pinch of salt can immensely help flavor even in sweet dishes.</li>
<li>Salt to taste: no recipe can precisely tell you how much salt you need, because for example, a teaspoon of sea salt is roughly <strong>half</strong> as salty as a teaspoon of table salt. Just use your taste buds.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seasoning">Seasoning<a class="anchor" href="#seasoning">#</a></h2>
<p>A classic thing that I used to do when following a recipe was skipping any spices that seemed more exotic than paprika. Another classic thing I used to do is wondering why my food tastes kinda bland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s obvious advice, but don&rsquo;t cheap out on spices.</p>
<p>They don&rsquo;t even have to be expensive: find any ethnic store and you will be greeted by shelves full of spices. And not those expensive, tiny bags you can get at the supermarket. My 2€ pack of powdered cumin has lasted me like two years now. Spices do lose flavor though, so you might have to use more to compensate.</p>
<p>Herbs are similarly important, with the added difficulty that the dried stuff doesn&rsquo;t even come close to fresh herbs. Luckily, fresh herbs are both decorative and tasty. A basil plant is worth it even if you&rsquo;re just using it for garnishing your pasta every now and then. But keep in mind many herbs are seasonal plants.</p>
<h2 id="equipment">Equipment<a class="anchor" href="#equipment">#</a></h2>
<p>Mostly all you need is one trip to Ikea:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food thermometer</strong>: perfect steak every time. Also, nailing frying oil temperature.</li>
<li><strong>Pans</strong> and <strong>pots</strong>:
<ul>
<li>You can make do with just a standard antistick pan and a pot, but an extra set of a small pan and pot is very convenient.</li>
<li>A heavier pan is nice, but your choice of pan isn&rsquo;t the most important thing in the world when you&rsquo;re starting out.</li>
<li>An oven-safe pan with tall sides is nice to have because these can double as baking dish</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s antistick, it&rsquo;ll thank you for never touching it with a spoon or fork or anything metal</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>strainer</strong>, unless you like accidentally dumping all of your spaghetti into the sink when trying to get rid of the pasta water</li>
<li>A <strong>chef&rsquo;s knife</strong>, and <strong>knife sharpener</strong> (Ikea has one for 10 bucks)
<ul>
<li>Knives quickly become dull, and dull knives aren&rsquo;t fun to use. Sharpen weekly or so.</li>
<li>You will use this knife a lot, so splurging a tiny bit is okay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mealprep <strong>containers</strong>, if you&rsquo;re into saving time and money while eating healthy</li>
<li><strong>Immersion blender</strong>: unlocks a <em>huge</em> number of recipes, plus it&rsquo;s cheap and takes little space</li>
<li><strong>Tongs</strong>: I personally prefer tongs over wooden spoons because they&rsquo;re so hard to flip things with.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should be able to get everything in good enough quality for roughly 100 bucks total.</p>
<p>You should also have a small pantry. These few things are going to get you pretty far already:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Baking powder</li>
<li>Vegetable oil</li>
<li>Canned tomatoes
<ul>
<li>if you got these 4 things, the only thing standing between you and a delicious pizza is some cheese!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sugar
<ul>
<li>congrats - now you can also make pancakes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic sauces like ketchup, mayonnaise, Sriracha, Worcestershire</li>
<li>Generous supply of ramen for <em>those</em> days
<ul>
<li>Also, ramen can actually be really nice if you spice them up with some fresh vegetables, actual meat, and a soft boiled egg maybe</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recipes">Recipes<a class="anchor" href="#recipes">#</a></h2>
<p>Generally, when you&rsquo;re just starting out, you suck at improvising. You may not think you do, but you <em>probably</em> do. For example, one of my staples back in the day was minced beef with broccoli. (Yup, that&rsquo;s literally it.) Add a tendency to underseason and you end up with a plate full of disappointment and a longing for McDonald&rsquo;s fries.</p>
<p>So don&rsquo;t improvise. Follow a good recipe, and you&rsquo;ll get one of those &ldquo;holy shit I just made that?&rdquo; moments. It&rsquo;s like a cheat code for a mind bendingly delicious meal. Some places to start looking:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JKenjiLopezAlt/featured">Kenji López-Alt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crook-Cook-Platinum-Recipes-Kitchen/dp/1452179611">Snoop Dogg&rsquo;s cookbook</a> (yes, seriously)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/">Salt Fat Acid Heat</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fitmencook.com/">FitMenCook</a> if you&rsquo;re on a diet</li>
<li><a href="https://tasty.co/">Tasty</a> if you&rsquo;re not on a diet</li>
</ul>
<p>I also recommend making your own cookbook, in the sense of keeping track of any recipe you like, and any modifications you&rsquo;ve made. It keeps you from losing track of your favorites, and deciding what to cook is easier when you have a huge list of meals you loved. A text file (or a physical notebook) is enough to get the job done, but I personally use a table in <a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a> because it&rsquo;s got a few powerful features for organizing the recipes, for example I can filter by ingredients.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m hoping this could help you get on track with cooking decent dishes for yourself.</p>
<p>If you find that cooking is fun to you and want to dig deeper than just following recipes, I can only recommend <a href="https://www.saltfatacidheat.com/">Salt Fat Acid Heat</a> again. It&rsquo;s a nice introduction to the science behind cooking. Afterwards, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Lab-Cooking-Through-Science/dp/0393081087">The Food Lab</a> is a good place to continue. Finally, you might also enjoy making cocktails, or baking. But be warned: both are rabbit holes in their own right.</p>
<p>Finally, practice a lot! Learning by experience works best, and it&rsquo;s cheap to experiment in the kitchen - worst case you have to order food.</p>
