<p>Recently, a family member replaced her aging 2012 Mac Mini with a custom gaming rig. Since then, it&rsquo;s been lying around, and because it&rsquo;s a decently specced machine for its time (Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM) I figured maybe there&rsquo;s some use I can put it to.</p>
<p>The main reasons for replacing it were lack of graphics power and it was extremely sluggish due to its old 5400rpm 2.5&quot; HDD. However, CPU performance is still in perfectly usable realms. Hooray for years of Intel stagnation!</p>
<p>The HDD is an easy fix - I had an old SATA SSD lying around, and thanks to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Mac+mini+Late+2012+Hard+Drive+Replacement/11716">iFixit</a> it was easy enough to swap. Getting into the Mini&rsquo;s internals was actually pretty fun - <a href="../xbox/">having opened an Xbox</a>, the Mini is surprisingly easy to work with.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really tightly packed though, which means it&rsquo;s got some unconventional quirks. For example, <em>all</em> mainboard connectors are nonstandard. Further, the mainboard slides out like a sled, but to get it out you need to insert levers into two special PCB cutouts. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/mac-mini-logic-board-removal-tool">U-shaped tool</a>, but you can make do with thin enough screwdrivers:</p>
<p><img src="../macmini1.jpg" alt="macmini jpg">
<img src="../macmini2.jpg" alt="macmini jpg"></p>
<p>After that it&rsquo;s smooth sailing. You just swap the drives, put everything back together, and boot into Internet Recovery by holding <code>⌘+R</code> during boot. Internet Recovery will let you install whatever version of macOS your Mac was delivered with.</p>
<p>For me that was OS X 10.8. Now using <em>that</em> was a throwback. Everything still was skeuomorphic back then. Just look at the Notes app!</p>
<p><img src="../mlnotes.jpg" alt="mlnotes jpg"></p>
<p>(<a href="https://news.softpedia.com/news/OS-X-Mountain-Lion-Features-Notes-254224.shtml">source</a>)</p>
<p>To upgrade from Mountain Lion, you&rsquo;ll have to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211683">grab an installer</a>. Using the app store directly does <em>not</em> work. I first installed Sierra and from there upgraded to Mojave via App Store. Support for the 2012 Mini was only dropped with Big Sur, so Catalina would&rsquo;ve worked too, but I&rsquo;m not too fond of its new security features such as notarization.</p>
<p>In the end, the system actually turned out pretty nice! Mojave is new enough to not lack any big features (<em>ahem</em> dark mode <em>ahem</em>), and with the SSD it&rsquo;s feeling real snappy again. Plus the Mini&rsquo;s design is timeless. I actually think it could do just fine as my main workhorse. Not bad for an 8 year old computer!</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve already got a <a href="../setups/">workhorse</a>, so what I&rsquo;ve been thinking about doing as educational project is replacing my cloud VPS with running my own dedicated server on the Mini.</p>
<p>In fact, it would be a pretty fat upgrade to my server which is currently 1C/1G with like 20GB of disk, turning it into 4C/8G plus 240GB disk. And the Mini is a machine that is exceptionally well suited to the purpose: there is a basically identical server model, so it&rsquo;s a reliable machine, it uses little power, it&rsquo;s tiny, and it&rsquo;s whisper quiet, yet relatively powerful. And it&rsquo;s even got a speaker so I can make it <code>say</code> things!</p>
<p>Apple also has very neat remote sharing features built into macOS, so I can easily run the Mini headless and connect to it via my main machine. It&rsquo;s literally a couple clicks to get to this:</p>
<p><img src="../macminis.png" alt="macminis png"></p>
<p>However macOS is a bit of a nonstandard server OS, so I&rsquo;ll have to see whether I can actually stick with it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a few things I might do with it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host an <a href="https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox">ArchiveBox</a></li>
<li>NAS
<ul>
<li>Nextcloud</li>
<li>Time Machine Backups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Zettelkasten</li>
<li>This blog</li>
<li>SSH server for my iPad</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these would do well to have more space than the crummy 240GB that my old SSD is offering. Luckily, the Mini&rsquo;s old 1TB HDD is right there, and you can actually install <em>two</em> 2.5&quot; drives in the Mini. You&rsquo;re going to need a special connector for the second drive though (<a href="https://eustore.ifixit.com/products/mac-mini-dual-drive-kit">iFixit</a>, <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32875202193.html">AliExpress</a>).</p>
<p>So once that&rsquo;s done, the final result is a slick 4C/8G machine with 240GB of SSD and 1TB of archiving space for all of 8€. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post an update once something is up and running.</p>
