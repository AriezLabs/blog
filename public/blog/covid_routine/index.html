<p>It&rsquo;s been almost exactly a year since COVID got real and so I thought I would write a bit on how my and my girlfriend&rsquo;s life has been throughout the pandemic. This is going to be kind of a snapshot since things are changing all the time, but I think it&rsquo;ll be nice to look back at this at some point into the future where life has hopefully returned to normal. Also, (mostly,) I&rsquo;m late with this post and I&rsquo;m out of ideas. So here goes nothing.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The good<a class="anchor" href="#the-good">#</a></h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin with the thing that has been our most consistent habit, which is having a proper brunch, usually at about noon, with some coffee, juice, yogurt, bread and/or a flavor-of-the-month main dish. Most recently that&rsquo;s been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leberk%C3%A4se">Leberkas</a> sandwich with a variety of extra toppings, such as a slice of Cheddar cheese, melted in the oven with some jalapeños on top, a fried egg, fried onions, barbecue sauce and mustard.</p>
<p>That is about as filling as it sounds, and of course it&rsquo;s really delicious too. One nice thing is that my local Hofer has pre-made but not yet baked Leberkas mixture so I&rsquo;ve made a few attempts at a BBQ seasoned Leberkas.</p>
<p>In general, since the lockdowns began I&rsquo;ve been experimenting a lot more in the kitchen, and while I enjoyed cooking before, the pandemic upgraded it to an actual hobby of mine. So if anything nice comes out of my brunch experiments, I&rsquo;ll share it.</p>
<p>Since brunch is pretty huge I&rsquo;m happy with a simple breakfast. Just like the main dish for our brunch I&rsquo;ve tried a bunch of things, but recently I converged on a handful of nuts mixed with some yogurt. This is really low in carbs, which is good because my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes">pancreas is kinda useless</a>, especially in the morning it seems, and it doesn&rsquo;t taste half as bad as it sounds. Plus it&rsquo;s so simple to prep I expect it&rsquo;ll still be viable once I have to leave early in the morning again. So I think I finally solved breakfast which is pretty nice too.</p>
<p>Not quite as consistent but arguably more important has been making an active effort to get outside every day. After COVID hit, it didn&rsquo;t take long to realize that spending the whole day inside fucks with your head badly. This was even more pronounced in our previous place, a tiny dorm room. You lose any sense of time, your memory goes to shit, you&rsquo;re lacking motivation and just feeling depressed.</p>
<p>We tried a bunch of things to improve this issue (for example going for walks or just hanging out outside) but in the end you&rsquo;re still spending 90% of your time indoors and this kind of place is just not suitable for that. You inevitably get sick of being stuck inside the same 20 square meters for basically all of your existence.</p>
<p>It got so bad that we moved out pretty much only because of that. In our new 1-bedroom apartment it&rsquo;s <em>much</em> better already (you can actually move around somewhat! and there&rsquo;s more than one tiny window) but we still need to get outside once a day minimum. Overall though the difference is so big that I suspect the quality of your living quarters is a major factor in whether you&rsquo;re one of those people that cope with the lockdown better than others, or not.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The bad<a class="anchor" href="#the-bad">#</a></h2>
<p>The negative effects of sitting at home might also be related to or amplified by Vitamin D deficiency which basically everyone stuck at home probably suffers from. Sadly we haven&rsquo;t been able to consistently take a supplement. It&rsquo;s such a tiny habit that you just forget.</p>
<p>Other things affected by never having to leave the house are your sleeping schedule and hygiene. It now requires a lot of conscious effort to maintain these at a level so basic that it would be taken for granted otherwise, because there&rsquo;s no anchors in your daily schedule - it&rsquo;s all up to you alone.</p>
<p>For us, during the darkest winter months, we typically went to bed at 2-3AM and woke up at ~11AM, meaning we saw a whooping 5 hours of sunlight a day. This has gotten better as the days are starting to get longer again but for a while the concept of day and night was pretty blurry.</p>
<p>I also haven&rsquo;t managed to exercise as consistently as I did before. Gyms are all locked down and so I&rsquo;ve been going for runs with my girlfriend instead. She&rsquo;s a runner, and to me running is actually a more fun kind of workout as well, so I might stick with occasional runs, but I still miss weightlifting. It just does something to your psyche that running doesn&rsquo;t, at least for me personally. Of course getting outside and seeing some nature has its upsides too, but I&rsquo;m struggling to find the motivation to go as often as I&rsquo;d go to the gym.</p>
<p>Unquestionably though, the single worst thing about the lockdowns has been the lack of social contact. We&rsquo;ve built a weekly habit out of seeing two of our friends to alleviate this issue, and it&rsquo;s nice having lockdown buddies. But in general you&rsquo;re still mostly sitting at home seeing the same people all day every day for what feels like forever now. It sucks not really knowing your classmates, and it sucks not being able to meet new people, and it sucks not being able to party. There&rsquo;s just nothing happening and you also can&rsquo;t make anything happen. Electronic entertainment is about the most fun thing you can do.</p>
<p>This issue wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as bad if all of my classes weren&rsquo;t online, which brings us to the second worst thing: distance learning. It just <em>sucks</em>. In theory it can do everything that in-person teaching can do. But this requires a <em>lot</em> of extra effort, which in practice no one puts in. Video conferences glitch out, professors don&rsquo;t give a fuck, at-home exams are laughably easy to cheat your way through, asking simple questions via mail is a multi-day endeavor, and there&rsquo;s no online substitute for break room chats.</p>
<p>Universities just aren&rsquo;t prepared and schools or kindergartens face basically the same issues. And it&rsquo;s been a year of this kind of low quality education. I don&rsquo;t think this will be entirely without consequences.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>So this mostly sounds pretty depressing, and it is. Where possible we&rsquo;ve tried to adapt to the new challenges, but managing everything as well as we did before is plainly too much to ask. What&rsquo;s bad is you tend to think it <em>should</em> be possible, and for the longest time I&rsquo;ve blamed myself, trying to improve what I could. But most of the stress that&rsquo;s piled on by the situation is just out of my control and I need to recognize and accept that if I don&rsquo;t want to crumble under it. Perfectly dealing with all of this just cannot reasonably be expected.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s not just us. Fact is that depression rates have been shooting up and I really don&rsquo;t think this is getting enough attention. People have needs, not dying of COVID is one of them, but politicians seem to act like this is the singular need that everyone currently has. And it might be true for some - fear is good motivation, a nice place makes staying at home pretty enjoyable, if you work remotely anyway nothing really changes, and introverts love social distancing.</p>
<p>But not everybody ticks one of those boxes. With lockdowns, we are actually making a tradeoff that&rsquo;s not as obvious and clear cut as it&rsquo;s commonly presented, and that&rsquo;s <em>if</em> it is even presented as such.</p>
