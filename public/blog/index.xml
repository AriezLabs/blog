      <description>This is an update pertaining to my last post. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a couple useful services and built a primitive but dynamic landing page.
Setup All the services are running their own servers, each listening on a different port. The landing page is powered by Node.js listening on port 80 and has links to everything else. Since some of the services are data intensive, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up the landing page to display current disk usage.</description>

      <description>Recently, a family member replaced her aging 2012 Mac Mini with a custom gaming rig. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been lying around, and because it&amp;rsquo;s a decently specced machine for its time (Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM) I figured maybe there&amp;rsquo;s some use I can put it to.
The main reasons for replacing it were lack of graphics power and it was extremely sluggish due to its old 5400rpm 2.5&amp;quot; HDD. However, CPU performance is still in perfectly usable realms.</description>

      <description>In the last few years, I have spent a lot of effort trying to find a nice computing setup. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally converged on something that I am pretty content with, at least right now during COVID and WFH. Of course, everybody has different needs, as a CS student I personally need a system that lets me take (preferably digital) handwritten notes and write code. With COVID, I also went back to playing video games more.</description>

      <title>Cooking 101</title>

      <description>This one&amp;rsquo;s for anyone just getting started with cooking.
While I&amp;rsquo;m far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that&amp;rsquo;s not too impressive in itself, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were so low that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald&amp;rsquo;s takeaway for dinner.</description>

      <description>The new year is a reflective period for many people, but this year I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to set my goals differently than I usually do. Firstly I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to figure out what my values currently are, then I came up with a bunch of ways to implement those values, and finally I selected the most promising ones to form the basis for concrete goals. Because it gets into the why and not just the what, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this approach will yield better results!</description>

      <description>I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a concise tutorial on CoreNFC&amp;rsquo;s NFCTagReader, so here goes nothing.
Prerequisites  You will need an Apple developer account Add the NFC capability to your project (in Signing &amp;amp; Capabilites, click the plus sign in the corner) Add a NFC Scan Usage Description to your Info.plist  NFC overview Generally speaking there are two types of NFC devices: active (e.g. your smartphone) and passive (e.g. a simple NFC tag).</description>

      <description>These are my notes on mucking around with my old Xbox One for a bit. I swapped the drive and thermal paste and did some amateurish performance measurements of the latter.
 Skip to #The upgrade for step-by-step instructions for upgrading your drive. Skip to #Thermal paste for the thermal paste upgrade  Context So I bought the original Xbox One in 2015 when it was on sale for like 200 bucks.</description>

      <description>Your router probably needs a static external IP? Not sure if mine&amp;rsquo;s got one If it&amp;rsquo;s got one, I can point my DNS at some port in my router, and forward that port to the Mini I got a LTE router and generally the connection sucks but LTE comes with nice uplink Otherwise there are dynamic DNS services such as  noip https://freedns.afraid.org/ https://github.com/ddclient/ddclient   Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll keep it all local for now.</description>
