* I'm a total MMO noob.
* New player onboarding is a bit rough.

## How to get rich (in Fallout 76)

Become a wasteland junk merchant.

* I like that you can sell items to other players. I didn't realize how powerful this was until I was somewhat experienced with the game. 
* I'm a habitual junk collector and amassed way more crafting materials than I could use, and so I put them up for sale. As soon as I got my first sale, I was hooked. I think some guy bought about 2200 Steel that I put up for one cap each, which netted me about 2000 caps after tax. At the time, that was a ton of money. I didn't even know what to buy with it. Mostly it made me not as anxious about fast traveling. 
* Since then, I've experimented a bit with the market. The fastest way to earn money I know of is collecting a ton of junk and selling it cheap. Quest rewards pale in comparison, and NPC vendor prices are a joke. I basically use NPC vendors as a marginally better trashcan.
* Junk, however, sells. 
* Just take everything you come across, including guns and armor dropped by enemies. You will need the junk weight reduction perk as well as the one that gives you higher ROI when scrapping weapons, and scrap the collected junk, guns and armor whenever you see a crafting station.
* Set up shop next to Vault 76 so people can travel to your camp for free. Less of a hurdle to go check out my vendors. (Not sure if others will travel to 76 then your CAMP because I have SSD)
* Rough pricing guidelines: screws, springs, gear, nuclear material at 10-15; adhesive, circuits, ... at 5-10; aluminum, copper at 4-6; lead, ... at 3-5; plastic, cloth at 2-3; steel, wood, leather at 1-2.
  * Go for the upper or lower bound depending on how fast you need to sell.
* Put up something of every category to lure more visitors
* Have a *ton* of junk. People looking for screws would rather go to someone offering 6K junk items than someone offering 200. You can even list a few thousand steel or something common at a high price so you'll always have a high number of items listed, but you have to be able to afford the space.

## How to beat the game easy

* Serverhop a lot: on a busy server, go for the nuke events, on a quiet server, farm resources.
* Whenever someone launches a nuke, join the event. You don't even have to be useful, you're just there for the rewards. Dying is free during an event. If you manage to deal a decent enough bit of damage to the boss, you'll even get boss loot. If not, go for the smaller enemies, they'll still give you tons of XP.
* Things get a lot easier once you get your first power armor and heavy guns.
* Spend your caps on ammo and fusion cores. Use heavy guns.
* You'll always have enough junk to repair your guns, and you can afford more ammo than you can shoot.
* There might be even stronger builds, but for me the game got a lot easier once I started doing this instead of going for a stealth sniper build.
