Recently, a family member replaced her aging 2012 Mac Mini with a custom gaming rig. It's been lying around, since it's a decently specced machine for its time (Ivy Bridge i7, 8GB RAM) I figured maybe there's some use I can put it to.

It got replaced because it lacked graphics power and it was extremely sluggish due to its old 5400RPM 2.5" HDD. Thanks to years of Intel stagnation, CPU performance is still alright. So upgrading it with an unused SSD leaves us with a system that's lacking graphics power - and for that there's a ton of projects. One particular thing I'd been thinking about doing as educational project is replacing my rented VPS with one that I'm running myself, and for that this machine is a decent fit! In fact, it would be a pretty fat upgrade to my server which is currently 1C/1G with 8GB of disk, turning it into 4C/8G plus 250GB disk.

The VPS is mostly for these tasks:

* Hosting an [ArchiveBox](ArchiveBox)
* Maybe a Nextcloud
* Backups
* My Zettelkasten
* This blog
* Doing actual work on my iPad via ssh

Since there's personal stuff involved I should do it securely:
