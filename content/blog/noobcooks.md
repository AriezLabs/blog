This one's for anyone just getting started with cooking. 

While I'm far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that's not too impressive but it's *far* from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were *so low* that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald's takeaway for dinner. 

Realizing that that's kind of a pathetic situation to be in, alongside the other benefits of cooking for yourself, such as saving money or healthy and delicious food, I went recipe hunting. Since then I've [made things official](../newyear21/) - cooking has become an actual hobby for me. So I thought it'd be fun to consider what advice I would give my old McDonald's me to kickstart his cooking career.


## Salt

Use a *ton* of salt.

Seriously. I'm not putting this first for no reason. If you're more the learning-by-experience type, try this experiment. (All credit goes to Samin Nosrat's Salt Fat Acid Heat).

### Caesar dressing

First we're going to make some mayo. Yep, *make* mayo, with our own damn hands. You're going to need an egg yolk **at room temperature**, and 175ml of vegetable oil.

Place a small bowl on a dishrag for stability. Put the yolk in and start whisking while adding oil **drop by drop**. I mean that literally. Mayo is an unforgiving bitch, and it's going to make you suffer if you add oil too quickly. You'll have to drip in the oil painfully slowly while your other arm is dying of exhaustion from whisking (I didn't say it was going to be a fun experiment).

Once you've added about half of the oil, you can go a bit faster, but don't get cocky - you can still easily fuck up your mayo at this stage, and the only way to save it is starting over.

When you're done, take some time to taste your fresh, homemade mayo. Was it worth the effort? Fuck no! This tastes like literally nothing.

Before you start making plans to murder me, let's move on to the second part of the experiment.

Prepare a few ingredients: pounded anchovies, garlic pounded with salt, Worcestershire sauce, table salt, and grated Parmesan cheese.

Now comes the fun part: add ingredients until it tastes amazing. And you can add a *lot*.

Finish it off with some lemon juice and vinegar. Do the same season-to-taste strategy.

As Samin recommends, you can serve your delicious sauce over some salad with croutons. An alternative that I also found delicious was mixing the mayo with Tuna and building a fat sandwich with some lettuce and other vegetables on top.

So if you're a complete noob I hope Samin's experiment could give you one of those "holy shit, I just made that?" moments. The reason this recipe works so well, Samin writes, is because you're layering salt from multiple different sources.

* The best experiment is SFAH's Caesar dressing
  * works great mixed with tuna on a sandwich!
  * Note: might need even more salt once mixed with the tuna
  * Note: this tastes so amazing because it's *layering* salts - there's salt in the anchovies, garlic, 
* Use salt everywhere (not always a shitton tho)

### Salting advice

* Salt from the inside: salt has numerous effects on food and most of them are desirable. For example it makes meat more tender, that's why yo usalt steak the day before.
* Careful: you might oversalt and only notice once it's mixed with the salad. When tasting, taste with some salad, to more closely resemble the final product


## Seasoning 

* Get spices and seasonings, don't just leave half of them out because they're inconvenient
  * You're cooking something, whimsically changing the recipe up so it's slightly more convenient, and leaving out half the spices because you've never heard of them. Your dish turns out grey and tastes roughly like water. Sound familiar?
  * Buy spices at ethnic shops, they're cheap and plentiful there
  * Herbs are best when fresh but they're seasonal plants

## Recipes

* Cook whatever tastes good to you. Unless that'll make you have to watch your health.
* When you're just starting out you suck at improvising. You may not think you do, but you do. Follow good recipes and you'll get a real "holy shit I just made that?" moment

    * In depth looks: SFAH and Kenji, Science of Cooking
* Create your own collection of recipes
  * you could use Notion, add ingredients, etc.

## Tools

Mostly all you need is one trip to Ikea.

* Don't even try steak without a thermometer
  * Salt your steak the night before
* Get decent pans etc, and if you're alone get small pans
* Get a strainer
* Decent chef's knife, and 10 bucks Ikea knife sharpener
* Mealprep containers, if you're into saving time and money while eating healthy
* Immersion blender - unlocks huge number of recipes, cheap, takes little space

## General/Conclusion

* Practice, practice, practice
* Have at least a tiny pantry on hand (depends on how much space you got ofc)
  * Flour, sugar, baking powder, canned tomatoes, vegetable oil
    * if you got that, the only thing standing between you and delicious fresh pizza is some cheese
    * further, ketchup, mayo, spices, 
  * Generous supply of ramen for *those* days
    * Can be a nice meal actually when you spice them up a bit with fresh vegetables
* Also, check out cocktails
