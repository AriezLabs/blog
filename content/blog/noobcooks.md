This one's for anyone just getting started with cooking. 

While I'm far from a master chef myself, I can in fact throw down a decently delicious dinner for a few guests. I realize that's not too impressive but it's *far* from where I was when I started college. Trust me. Back then the standards set by my cooking skills were *so low* that I was legitimately hyped when I treated myself to some McDonald's takeaway for dinner. 

Realizing that that's kind of a pathetic situation to be in, alongside the other benefits of cooking for yourself, such as saving money or healthy and delicious food, I went recipe hunting. Since then I've [made things official](../newyear21/) - cooking has become an actual hobby for me. So I thought it'd be fun to consider what advice I would give my old McDonald's me to kickstart his cooking career.


## Salt

Use a *ton* of salt.

Seriously. I'm not putting this first for no reason. If you're more the learning-by-doing type, here's an experiment that will make up your mind once and for all. (All credit goes to Samin Nosrat's Salt Fat Acid Heat).

First we're going to make some mayo. Yep, *make* mayo, with our own damn hands. You're only going to need an egg yolk **at room temperature**, and 175ml of vegetable oil.

Place a small bowl on a damp dishrag for stability. Put the yolk in and start whisking while adding oil **drop by drop**. Literally. Mayo is an unforgiving bitch, and it's going to make you suffer if you add oil too quickly. You know you're doing it right if you're dripping in oil painfully slowly, with the remaining amount never seeming to shrink even a tiny bit, while your other arm is dying of exhaustion from whisking (I didn't say it was going to be a fun experiment).

As more oil is added, you can begin dripping a *tiny* bit faster. Don't get cocky - you can still easily fuck up your mayo. If you add oil too fast, your mayo will stop being creamy and become flaky. To save it, you gotta start over - just add the rest of the oil to your broken mayo, then put half a teaspoon of hot tap water into another bowl, and whisk your broken mayo mixture into that. Drop-wise, of course.

Once done, take some time to taste your mayo. After all, it's the product of a *lot* of pain, so this fresh, homemade mayo better be worth the effort. 

But wait - it just tastes like nothing at all?

Now before you start making plans to find and murder me, let's move on to the second part of the experiment real quick. This one is going to be fun, I promise.

Prepare the other ingredients: pound some anchovies and some garlic, grate some Parmesan, and keep your Worcestershire sauce and table salt ready. Then progressively mix them into your mayo until it tastes amazing. 

Since it's an experiment, you should also try going beyond the point where it tastes amazing - you can always dilute your overseasoned mayo with unseasoned mayo. I won't even be mad at you if you use store-bought mayo for that. 

Finish it off with some lemon juice and vinegar. Do the same season-to-taste strategy. 

Better now?

It should be a *world* of difference between this and your original, bland ass unseasoned mayo. Note how much of each ingredient you've added - most likely, you will find it can take a lot more than you expected. The reason this recipe works so well, Samin writes, is because you're *layering* salt from multiple different sources (each of our ingredients contains a lot of salt on its own).

You can serve your delicious dressing over some lettuce with croutons and impress your date (or your mum) with it. Thank me later. An alternative that I also found to be delicious is mixing the mayo with Tuna and building a fat sandwich with some lettuce and sliced bell peppers.

Now that it's clear *why* you should salt, let's conclude with a few general tips:

* Salt from the inside: salt has numerous effects on food and most of them are desirable. For example it makes meat more tender, that's why yo usalt steak the day before.
* Use salt everywhere (not always a shitton tho)


## Seasoning 

* Get spices and seasonings, don't just leave half of them out because they're inconvenient
  * You're cooking something, whimsically changing the recipe up so it's slightly more convenient, and leaving out half the spices because you've never heard of them. Your dish turns out grey and tastes roughly like water. Sound familiar?
  * Buy spices at ethnic shops, they're cheap and plentiful there
  * Herbs are best when fresh but they're seasonal plants

## Recipes

* Cook whatever tastes good to you. Unless that'll make you have to watch your health.
* When you're just starting out you suck at improvising. You may not think you do, but you do. Follow good recipes and you'll get a real "holy shit I just made that?" moment

    * In depth looks: SFAH and Kenji, Science of Cooking
* Create your own collection of recipes
  * you could use Notion, add ingredients, etc.

## Tools

Mostly all you need is one trip to Ikea.

* Don't even try steak without a thermometer
  * Salt your steak the night before
* Get decent pans etc, and if you're alone get small pans
* Get a strainer
* Decent chef's knife, and 10 bucks Ikea knife sharpener
* Mealprep containers, if you're into saving time and money while eating healthy
* Immersion blender - unlocks huge number of recipes, cheap, takes little space

## General/Conclusion

* Practice, practice, practice
* Have at least a tiny pantry on hand (depends on how much space you got ofc)
  * Flour, sugar, baking powder, canned tomatoes, vegetable oil
    * if you got that, the only thing standing between you and delicious fresh pizza is some cheese
    * further, ketchup, mayo, spices, 
  * Generous supply of ramen for *those* days
    * Can be a nice meal actually when you spice them up a bit with fresh vegetables
* Also, check out cocktails
