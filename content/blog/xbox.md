## Context

So I bought the original Xbox One in 2015 when it was on sale for like 200 bucks. It's mostly just been sitting around, but recently I gave it another shot because COVID-19-induced homeoffice did not work well for me. I was getting distracted a *lot* on my work computer which also doubled as gaming rig. So busting out the Xbox again was one way to have a separate work environment and hopefully improve that. 

I was originally planning to build a separate gaming rig, but I've become casual enough that the Xbox works perfectly fine for my purposes. So why spend the extra money? Even the old issue of expensive game prices on consoles doesn't matter that much nowadays. The Game Pass gives me more games than I can play for the same price as Netflix. And surprisingly high quality titles too.

So I went ahead, got the Game Pass and downloaded a few titles that seemed nice - Forza Horizon 4, Fallout 76, The Outer Worlds, and boom - about 75% of disk space gone. Back in the day I thought CoD MW2 was huge at like 16GB, but things have gotten ridiculous nowadays.

Luckily I had a 2TB SATA SSD lying around because it (not so luckily) didn't work for its intended purpose, cloning and expanding my Hackintoshs' macOS install that is confined to a tiny old 240GB SSD. APFS doesn't seem to be able to expand, and I was frankly too lazy to reinstall. Waiting for Big Sur for that.

So the next best thing was upgrading the Xbox with it. 

## The upgrade

It turns out that unlike with APFS, upgrading your Xbox drive is a relative piece of cake. You basically just plug it in (doesn't even have to be formatted in any way) and install the OS to it via USB. You do have to redownload your games and apps if you do it this way. But that's a minor issue to me.

1. Physically swap the drive
2. Get OSU1 (unless your console is one of those special cases)
3. Format a USB drive with NTFS
4. Copy the data over
5. Plug it in
6. Hold the Pair and Eject buttons
7. Wait.
