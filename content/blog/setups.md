# Computing setups

In the last few years, I have spent a lot of effort trying to find a nice computing setup. I've finally converged on something that I am pretty content with, at least right now during COVID and WFH. Of course, everybody has different needs, as a CS student I personally need a system that lets me take (preferably digital) handwritten notes and write code. With COVID, I also went back to playing video games more. So right now, my personal requirements are:

* Touchscreen and stylus
* Big screen for coding
* Something to game on

In 2017, I started college with a 12" MacBook and 1st gen iPad Pro. This setup was pretty great. I couldn't really game, but back then you could have a social life, so that was fine. 

I *loved* the MacBook, it's a very convenient form factor, you could easily take it literally everywhere, it had USB-C docking, and it was just a pleasure to use in general. I think the original iPad Pro was a bit ahead of its time though, as in the tech wasn't quite ready yet. It got pretty warm when taking notes and I burned through almost half a charge in 3 hours of lectures. Back then my note taking system wasn't particularly sophisticated either (I was basically just taking standard handwritten notes in OneNote) and so I suspect I would've been just as happy with a pen and paper in place of the iPad.

In 2019, the MacBook slowly started to show its age (it got a bit slower with each OS update, as always). So I moved on to a ThinkPad X390 Yoga, hoping that it could replace both my laptop and my tablet. Turns out, flipping the display around is pretty awkward. So if you're writing and want to do a quick drawing or something, you either draw onto the erected screen (awkward) or you drop the screen to 180 degrees and draw (awkward) or you flip it (awkward). It's always *either* a laptop *or* a tablet, never both at the same time. And boy, is it a clunky tablet, both physically and from a usability standpoint. Neither Linux nor Windows are particularly usable with just a touchscreen, as is evident from (lack of) autorotate, tiny buttons, and many other minor annoyances that sum up into an unpleasurable experience.

The other issue with the X390 was shitty Linux support. The WiFi driver consistently crashed every couple of minutes when you had a Thunderbolt display connected. Each crash froze the system for a few seconds and they happened every few minutes, depending on kernel and driver version. It was really really annoying and I tried *everything*. No avail.

So while I had the highest expectations for this setup, I have to rate it the worst out of all I've had so far. Complete fucking disappointment, to be frank. The awkwardness of the form factor even would've been tolerable if the software wasn't close to unusable.

Finally, in 2020, I bought an iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard on kind of a whim when it came out. That thing has been the best implementation of the Convertible idea that I've seen so far, but still it's nowhere near its potential. *Seriously* limited by iPadOS. Blink is a livesaver in that it gives you a proper shell, but it's on a VPS so if you're working on files you need to move them around constantly, which is awkward again. Basically, it's great for any everyday tasks, and there are ways to do most other things you need, but I wouldn't use it as my only computing device.

So I dusted off my old gaming rig and turned it into a Hackintosh (easy enough - just needed a new WiFi card). This thing has been *rock solid* and probably my favorite computing device so far. Upgradeability is worth a lot (I just recently moved to a 1TB SSD. For 80 bucks. Apple charges *several hundred*!) Kept it as a Windows dual boot for a while, but I ended up getting an AMD GPU which, unlike my previous Nvidia GPU, is compatible with macOS. And so the need to dualboot was gone, as I can play LoL on macOS, and anything else on my [Xbox](Xbox) with Game Pass.

But my gaming rig is getting old. It's a Skylake, SATA SSD, DDR3 RAM, all that jazz. Individually each of those doesn't have a massive impact on performance, but I imagine that a new rig overall could perform a lot better. However I'm not sure that that's worth dropping ~a grand on. The rig is still within *usable* realms. And I'm not sure how long Intel Macs are getting support from both Apple and other software vendors. I guess it'd be long enough that a new rig won't get dropped before it's quite slow anyhow. But again I don't really have a reason to go for a big upgrade right now. Intel's new Rocket Lake might be worth something, even though it's still 14nm, but since Apple is apparently not going to release new Intel Macs (for now), it'll be interesting to see whether they are supported well enough to be used as a daily driver. I would be going for a SFF build because they're sexy and I'm traveling a lot. 

The thing is I *want* to upgrade it but I literally can't justify it. Intel has stagnated so hard.

In any case, my current setup is the happiest I've been so far. The 12" MacBook was nice too, but it's just too slow for my needs right now. The iPad Pro is severely limited by software and you're locked in to Apple (maybe Asahi Linux can run on it someday? that'd be pretty amazing) but working on a VPS is still the least awkward compromise available right now. It's also well made in ways the X390 just wasn't (120hz, magnetic pen, actually usable as a <500g tablet unlike giant 13", 1.3kg hunk of metal).
