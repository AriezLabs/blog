It's been almost exactly a year since COVID got real and so I thought I would document the state that me and my girlfriend's daily routine has currently evolved to under social distancing. This is kind of a snapshot since things are changing all the time, but I think it might be nice to be able to look back at this at some point into the future where life has hopefully returned to normal. Also, (mostly,) I'm late with this post and I'm out of ideas. So here goes nothing.

Let's begin with the thing that has been the most of a constant throughout the past year, which is having a proper brunch, usually at about noon, with some coffee, juice, yogurt, bread and/or a flavor-of-the-month main dish. Most recently that's been a [Leberkas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leberk%C3%A4se) sandwich with a variety of extra toppings, such as a slice of Cheddar cheese, melted in the oven with some jalape√±os on top, a fried egg, fried onions, barbecue sauce and mustard.

That is about as filling as it sounds, and of course it's really delicious too. One nice thing is that my local Hofer has pre-made but not yet baked Leberkas mixture so I've made a few attempts at a BBQ seasoned Leberkas. In general my Leberkas stint has been pretty long lived compared to the rest, but I've kind of grown tired of it recently and so just a few days ago I've started experimenting with McDonald's breakfast burger style sandwiches. As in ham and egg, cheese, lettuce and mayo. I'll have to see where that goes, if anything nice comes out of it, I might share it.

Since our brunch is pretty huge I'm happy with a simple breakfast. Just like the main dish for our brunch I've tried a bunch of things, but recently I converged on a handful of nuts mixed with some yogurt. This is really low in carbs, which is good because my [pancreas is kinda useless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_1_diabetes), especially in the morning it seems, and it doesn't taste half as bad as it sounds. Before that I've had scrambled eggs but you do get tired of these - they're just not something for every single day. And they take a lot more effort to prep, especially as a zombie just after waking up.

Not quite as consistent but arguably more important has been making an active effort to get outside every day. After COVID hit, it didn't take long to realize that spending the whole day inside fucks with your head. This was even more pronounced in our previous tiny dorm room. You lose your sense of time, your memory goes to shit, you're lacking motivation and just feeling depressed. It got so bad that we moved out pretty much only because of that. Now in a proper apartment it's much better (you can actually move around somewhat! and there's more than one tiny window) but we still need to get outside for at least a walk or something. Some people seem to be able to deal with it, but we can't. Even with going for a walk, days feel much shorter ever since the lockdowns began.

The negative effects might actually be related to Vitamin D deficiency which basically everyone stuck at home probably suffers from. Sadly we haven't been able to consistently take a supplement. It's such a tiny habit that you just forget.

Other things affected by never having to leave the house are your sleeping schedule and hygiene. It now requires a lot of conscious effort to maintain these at a level so basic that it would be taken for granted otherwise. During the darkest winter months we typically went to bed at 2-3AM, waking up at ~11AM, meaning we saw a whooping 5 hours of sunlight a day. This has gotten better as the days are starting to get longer again but for a while the concept of day and night was pretty blurry.

I also haven't been able to exercise as consistently as I did before. Gyms are all locked down and so I've been going for runs with my girlfriend instead. She's a runner, and to me this is actually a more fun kind of workout as well, so I might stick with occasional runs, but I still miss weightlifting. It just does something to your psyche that running doesn't, at least for me personally. But of course getting outside and seeing some nature has its upsides too.

Unquestionable though, the single worst thing about the lockdowns has been the lack of social contact. We're making efforts to see friends regularly (the *same two* friends, for you hysterics) but in general you're just sitting at home seeing the same people all day every day for what feels like forever now. This obviously leads to tensions. Plus humans generally are social creatures. The nonexistent social life is just about the worst thing about social distancing. The second worst is that it takes your routine away.

So far most of these things sound pretty depressing, and they are. It's a fact that depression rates have been shooting up, especially for youner people, and I really don't think this issue is getting enough attention. But I want to end this on a bit of a positive note. It's been hard but I think we've made it through the worst.
